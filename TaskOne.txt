1. Create three variables in a single line and assign values to them in such a manner that each one ofthem belongs to a different data type.

>>> a ,b,c = 2, 3.4, (5-2j)
>>> a
2
>>> b
3.4
>>> c
(5-2j)

2.Create a variable of type complex and swap it with another variable of type integer.

>>> c = a
>>> c
2

3.Swap two numbers using a third variable and do the same task without using any third variable.
#using third variable
>>> a =20
>>> b = 10
>>> temp = a
>>> a = b
>>> b = temp

#without using any third variable
>>> a =20
>>> b = 10
>>> a = a+b
>>> a
30
>>> b = a- b
>>> b
20
>>> a = a-b
>>> a
10


4.Write a program that takes input from the user and prints it using both Python 2.x and Python 3.xVersion.

python version 3
x = input()

print(x)

#python version 2 
eval(raw_input("Enter input:))
print "x"


5.Write a program to complete the task given below:Ask users to enter any 2 numbers in between 1-10 , add the two numbers and keep the sum inanother variable called z. Add 30 to z and store the output in variable result and print result as thefinal output.

>>> x = int(input())
4
>>> y = int(input())
3
>>> z = x+y
>>> z +=30
>>> result = z
>>> print(result)
37
>>> 


6.Write a program to check the data type of the entered values.HINT: Printed output should say -The data type of the input value is : int/float/string/etc

x = eval(input())
print("The data type of input value is:", type(x))
The data type of input value is: <class 'int'>


7.Create Variables using formats such as Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, SnakeCase andUPPERCASE.

#upper camelcase
firstNumber
#lower camelcase
FirstNumber
#snake case
first_number

8.If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

Yes it will change the value of a since python is dynamic language.
A dynamic programming language is a programming language in which operations 
otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time. 
So the the datatype of variable is decided at runtime.
